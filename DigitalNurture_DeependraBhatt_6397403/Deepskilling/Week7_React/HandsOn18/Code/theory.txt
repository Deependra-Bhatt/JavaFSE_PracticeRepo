-->Need for Unit Testing
Unit testing is needed to test whther all the React components are working smoothly and as expected.
It helps to find errors and bugs early and fixing them
It makes the application more reliable, robust and easier to maintain


--> Working with Jest and Enzyme
1. Jest: It is  Unit Testing framework.
        It also helps you to mock the behaviour of dependencies needed.
        It provides with test() and expect() functions, for writing assertions.

2. Enzyme: Enzyme is the framework that helps developers and testers to interact with the React Components during testing
            It also provide with utility fucntions to render the React Components in a test environment.

Working Together: Jest is the general testing framework that provides the environment, assertions, and mocking. 
                    Enzyme provides specific tools that make it easy to render and interact with React components within that Jest environment. 
                    We use Jest to define the tests and assertions, and Enzyme to render and manipulate the React components for those tests.


        
 --> Types of Router Components

1. BrowserRouter:
    Uses HTML5 history API, and creates clean URL's
    Requires server-side configuration to handle direct URL access

2. HashRouter:
    Uses hash portion of URL to keep UI in sync
    Does not require server-side configuration as everything after the hash is ignored by the server


<Route>: Defines a path and component to render.
<Link>: Used for navigation between different routes
