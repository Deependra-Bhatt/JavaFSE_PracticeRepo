--> React Events 

Events describe how the UI interacts with user actions like clicks, keyPress, etc.
These are similar to DOM events, but more efficient performance.


--> Event Handlers

These are functions that are executed when a specific event happens.
These are attached as attributes to the JSX element, using a special naming convention.
Example:
function myButton(){
    function handleClick(){
        alert('Button Clicked');
    }
    return (
        <button onClick={handleClick}>
            Click more
        </button>
    );
}

-- Synthetic Event 

A Synthetic Event is React's cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event. 
React normalizes these events so that they have the same properties across different browsers, 
meaning you don't have to worry about browser inconsistencies when handling events. 
When an event occurs, React creates a Synthetic Event object and passes it to your event handler.

--> React Event Naming convention
1. CamelCase: Event names are written in camelCase like onClick, OnMouseOver,etc.
2. on Prefix: Event names start with prefix on followed bu event type.

Some Examples:

onClick: for a mouse clicks
onSubmit: for form submissons
onKeyDown: for a key press down
