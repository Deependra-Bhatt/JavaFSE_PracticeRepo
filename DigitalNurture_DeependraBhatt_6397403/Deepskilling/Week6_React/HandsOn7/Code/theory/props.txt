Props: Props means "properties".
        In react, props are used to pass data from a parent component to child component (uni-directional manner).
        They are like function arguments, you pass data into a component to provide it with the neede information to render.
        They are read only.

Default Props: As the name suggest, these props are used to set a default value for a component,
                if they are not explicitly passed by parent component.


ReactDOM.render(): It is a method provide by react-dom package, responsible for rendering an element(or component)
                    into the actual DOM of web page.
                    Syntax:
                            ReactDOM.render(element,container,[callback]);


Difference between State and Props:

Feature	            State	                                            Props

Managed By	        Internal to the component.  	                    Parent component.
Mutabililty	        Mutable 	                                        Immutable (read-only).
Purpose	            Manages data that changes within the component	    Passes data and configurations from parent to child.
Origin	            Defined and managed inside the component.	        Passed from the parent component as attributes.
Flow	            Can be passed down as props to child components	    Flow down from parent to child only.


Simply,
        Props are like the arguments passed to the function.
        whereas,
        State is like a local variable within a function.
