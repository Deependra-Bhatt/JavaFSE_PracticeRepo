Q-> What is SPA and what are its benefits?
    SPA(Single Page Application) is a web application that dynamically updates a single HTML page as the user interacts with the app.

    In simple terms, we don't need to reload an entire new HTML page, the SPA swaps out the content of the current page and replaces it.

Benefits of SPA:

1. It is not required to full page reload, hence faster user experience
2. Better performance, since it loads mostly what needed at once 
3. SPA simplifies backend API interaction, as it does not need to reload the entire hence focuses on only what is needed
4. Better caching 
5. Simplified deployment

Cons:
1. Poor SEO support
2. Higher initial load time
3. SPA needs complex client-side routing
