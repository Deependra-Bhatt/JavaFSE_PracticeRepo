React: 
        React is an open-source JavaScript library developed by Facebook for developing UI(user interfaces),
        particularly Single Page Applications where data changes over time.
        It encourages a declarative programming style, and effcient DOM manipulation using virtual DOM.

Virtual DOM:
        A Virtual DOM is a lightweight in-memory copy of the actual DOM, acting as a practice copy before making changes to the actual DOM.
        React compares the virtual DOM with the real DOM and then updates only the necessary parts (called reconciliation).
        Thus, it improves performance and user experience.

Working:
        React works by creating a Virtual DOM (Document Object Model) which is a practice copy, i.e a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. 
        When the state of a component changes, React first updates the Virtual DOM (practice copy), and then efficiently calculates the differences between the new Virtual DOM and the previous one. 
        Finally, it updates only the necessary parts of the actual DOM, and improving performance. 
        This whole process is called reconciliation.

Features of React:
    
1. JSX(JavaScript & XML): It enables yo to write HTML code directly in javascript.
2. Virtual DOM: React creates a practice a copy known as virtual DOM where all the changes are done before doing in actual DOM.
3. One-Way Data Binding: Data in react flows from parent component to child component.ensuring data flowing is one-directional.
4. Fast Rendering: With the use of Virtual DOM,the rendering process becomes smooth.React updates only what's needed rather than loading the entire page.
5. Component-based architecture: React uses small, independent, and reusable blocks known as components.
