React Components: 
    Components are the building blocks of the React application.
    Each Component represents a reusable UI piece, they accept inputs and return React elements.

Types of Components in React:

1. Class Components:
                    Can use state and lifecycle methods, uses classes.
                    It is defined using an ES6 class and must extend Component.
                    It must have a render() method that returns JSX.
                    Example: 
                        class Welcome extends Component {
                            render() {
                                return <h1>I am a Class Component</h1>;
                            }
                        }

2. Function Components:
                    It is a plain JavaScript function, it takes props and returns JSX.
                    With React Hooks, function component can manage state and lifecycle too.
                    Example: 
                        function Welcome() {
                            return <h1>I am a Function Component</h1>;
                        }


--> render(): 
            The render() method is mandatory in class components.
            It returns the JSX which gets rendered in the DOM.
            Example: 
                render() {
                    return <h1>My name is Deependra.</h1>;
                }

--> Component Construtor:
            In class component, the construtor() method is used to:
            i. initailize state
            ii. bind event handlers

            Example:
                constructor(props) {
                    super(props);
                    this.state = {
                        name: 'React'
                    };
                }


Difference between React Component and JavaScript

 Feature                  React Component                 JavaScript Function                    

 Return Type              JSX (React elements)            Any data type (number, string, etc.)   
 React Lifecycle Support  Yes (for class components)      No                                     
 Reusability in UI        Yes                             Not designed for UI                    
 Props Handling           Automatically receives `props`  Requires explicit parameter definition 
 Rendering in DOM         Yes (with JSX)                  No direct rendering
