ASYMPTOTIC NOTATION

What is Big O Notation?
Big O Notation is a mathematical way to describe how an algorithm's runtime or space requirements grow as the input size increases.
i)	It expresses the upper bound of an algorithmâ€™s running time.
ii)	Focuses on performance and scalability.

Why It's Useful
i)	Helps compare algorithms regardless of hardware.
ii)	Lets developers choose the most efficient approach.

 Search Case Scenarios

Scenario	    Linear Search	    Binary Search
Best Case	    	O(1)	                O(1)
Average Case		O(n)	                O(log n)
Worst Case	    	O(n)	                O(log n)


NOTE: 
	Linear Search is used for unsorted and small inputs.
	Binary Search is used for sorted and large inputs.
