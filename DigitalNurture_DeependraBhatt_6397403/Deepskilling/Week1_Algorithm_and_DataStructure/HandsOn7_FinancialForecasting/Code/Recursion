Recusrion: When a function is called within its own body, it is known as recursion.

It is used in natural recursive cases like compounding, divide-conquer, etc.

Syntax:

        void functionName(parameters){
            if(baseCase){
                return ;
            }

            return functionName(updatedParameters); // recursive call
        }
